When looking at the relationship between factor and time, we see that there is a pattern of exponential growth
that occurs as time progresses, in which the pattern looks to be cubing the following number.

When looking at the relationship between factor and time and pi, there seems to be an increase of the pi value
as time increases, but then there is a dramatic drop from 4.0 from the first two minutes
to around the value of 3.14, in which the number stabilizes at roughly for the remainder of the time.

When looking at the relationship between pi and factor, we see a drop once again from the 4.0 value of pi when the
factor is small, around a value of 1, then as the factor increases exponentially, the pi value still remains
close to a value of 3.14.

All in all, there seems to be a strong positive relationship with the time and factor variables in which factor increases exponentially
as time increases. However, the relationships between time and pi as well as pi and factor seem to have very little relationship as pi stays around the same value even when increasing both time and factor variables.
